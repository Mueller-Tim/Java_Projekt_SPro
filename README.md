## Description: "Project: S-Pro Time Schedule Pro"
In this project, we have developed an automatic shift scheduling application.
The project is written in Java and was carried out as part of a PM3 course at the ZHAW School of Engineering.

## Requirements
- JDK 18
- Java IDE (Intellij, Eclipse)
- Gradle 7.6

## Run the project
To run the application, you need to run the command `gradle run` in the root project folder.
It's possible to run the project directly via the main method in the class `ch.zhaw.spro.SetUpUI`. However, you will need the fitting java components. 

## Technical report II
Technical implementations such as design decisions, ER-Diagram, Package-Diagram and the UML can be found in the technical report II.
